# Switch Statement in C++

### Objective

In this project, our main goal is to understand how to use switch-statement in C++.

### Problem

Develop a program that displays a student's grade based on his score using **switch statement**. 

|  Score  |  Grade  |
|:-------:|:-------:|
| 100-90  |    A    |
| 89-80   |    B    |
| 79-70   |    C    |
| 69-60   |    D    |
| less than 60 |   F   |



### Implementation
- Write your code in the main function.
  
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int score = 75;
    /* Your code here*/
    return 0;
}

```
